	We normally do not have enough time to eat all of our lunch. Even though we are allowed to bring
	our lunches outside, we cannot go inside the school to put them back, so we have to hold our lunch
	bags all of lunch.

	Even though the point of the Outside Lunches is to get people moving around outside, a lot of
	people are just standing around outside the doors, waiting to go inside. This defeats the purpose
	of the Outside Lunch.

<p class="text-sm">
	Outside Lunches do not wait for the weather. If it is a set Outside Lunch, we have to go outside,
	even if it is raining or super cold. Also, we are not always given notice that a certain day will
	be an Outside Lunch, so we are not always prepared.
